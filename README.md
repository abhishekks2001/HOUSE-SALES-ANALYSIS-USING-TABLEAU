PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project involves analyzing house sales data for King County, USA, encompassing homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. The dataset includes various attributes such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage of living space, lot size, condition, grade, and more. The primary goal is to develop an interactive dashboard using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

The dashboard features daily average house sales price, sales price per region, and distributions based on attributes like bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage. Users can filter data based on parameters such as month, year built, and square footage. Additionally, the dashboard provides insights into the distribution of house prices, views versus condition, and other relevant metrics.

By visualizing and exploring the data through an interactive dashboard, stakeholders can gain valuable insights into trends, patterns, and factors influencing house sales in King County. This enables informed decision-making for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals operating in the region.
